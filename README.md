# FYP-OCT-image-Synthesis
In this project we are using DC GANS to generate OCT images. GANS were trained in tensorflow libraries.
The purpose of this project is to generate OCT images which after generation will be evaluated by different models and then from professionals.
Then these images can be used for training different models which can be classification models or anything.
